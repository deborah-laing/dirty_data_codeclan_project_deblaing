# **1. Project Brief**

The task assigned to our group was to clean, tidy, and combine three datasets into one set, and answer a series of analysis questions.

The three datasets contained survey information on Halloween habits and preferences, with respondents asked to rate a series of candy items.


### **1.1. Raw Datasets - Observations**

The three datasets were observed to be non-uniform, with each dataset containing unique columns in comparison to the others as well as sharing some commonalities. This gave the group the first indications on how to begin cleansing the data before attempting to combine into one large dataset.


# **2. Data Cleaning - Methodology and Action Plan**

The datasets were read into our R script.

Our group of four decided to divide in the first instance and do a preliminary investigation of the datasets; three of us took a dataset each to scope out the variables and report back on any anomalies or potential challenges, and the fourth member began breaking down the analysis questions to determine which particular data would be needed to answer the analysis questions.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)

raw_candy_2015 <- read_excel(
  here("raw_data/boing-boing-candy-2015.xlsx")
)

raw_candy_2016 <- read_excel(
  here("raw_data/boing-boing-candy-2016.xlsx")
)

raw_candy_2017 <- read_excel(
  here("raw_data/boing-boing-candy-2017.xlsx")
)
```


### **2.2. Breakdown of Tasks**

The group reconvened and determined that a significant portion of the data would not be needed to carry out the analysis, therefore we would standardise the individual raw datasets to contain the following columns:

*Combined_ID*    
*Year*    
*Age*  
*Trick or Treat*  
*Candy Type*  
*Rating*  
*Country*  
*State or Province*  
*Gender*  

From this we would use the '(rbind)' function to combine the datasets into one, which could be further tidied and refined.

# **3. Approach**

### **3.1. Individual Datasets - Initial Cleaning**

As a group we collaborated on writing code that could be used to streamline the 2015 data, tested to ensure it worked as expected:

```{r eval=FALSE}
candy_clean_2015 <- clean_names(raw_candy_2015) %>% 
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(str_sub(timestamp, start = 1, end = 4)),
         .before = timestamp,
         Dataset = Year) %>% 
  rowid_to_column("ID") %>%
  rename("Age" = "how_old_are_you", 
         "Trick_or_Treat" = "are_you_going_actually_going_trick_or_treating_yourself") %>% 
  unite("Combined_ID", c("Dataset", "ID"), sep = "_") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("butterfinger":"york_peppermint_patties"),
               names_to = "Candy_Type",
               values_to = "Rating") %>% 
  add_column(Country = NA,
             State_or_Province = NA,
             Gender = NA) %>% 
  select("Combined_ID", "Year", "Age", "Trick_or_Treat", "Candy_Type", "Rating", "Country", "State_or_Province", 
         "Gender"); 
```

Once we were confident that this code functioned as intended, we applied it to the datasets for 2016 and 2017 customising the code to account for differences in the raw data compared to the 2015 dataset: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
candy_clean_2016 <- clean_names(raw_candy_2016) %>% 
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(str_sub(timestamp, start = 1, end = 4)),
         .before = timestamp,
         Dataset = Year) %>% 
  rowid_to_column("ID") %>%
  rename("Age" = "how_old_are_you",
         "Trick_or_Treat" = "are_you_going_actually_going_trick_or_treating_yourself",
         "Gender" = "your_gender",
         "Country" = "which_country_do_you_live_in",
         "State_or_Province" = "which_state_province_county_do_you_live_in") %>% 
  unite("Combined_ID", c("Dataset", "ID"), sep = "_") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("x100_grand_bar":"york_peppermint_patties"),
               names_to = "Candy_Type",
               values_to = "Rating") %>%
  select("Combined_ID", "Year", "Age", "Trick_or_Treat", "Candy_Type", "Rating", "Country", "State_or_Province", 
         "Gender");

candy_clean_2017 <- clean_names(raw_candy_2017) %>% 
  rename("Age" = "q3_age", 
         "Gender" = "q2_gender", 
         "Trick_or_Treat" = "q1_going_out", 
         "Country" = "q4_country", 
         "State_or_Province" = "q5_state_province_county_etc") %>%
  rowid_to_column("ID") %>%
  add_column(Year = "2017") %>%
  mutate(Dataset = Year) %>% 
  unite("Combined_ID", c("Dataset", "ID"), sep = "_") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = ("q6_100_grand_bar":"q6_york_peppermint_patties"),
               names_to = "Candy_Type",
               values_to = "Rating") %>% 
  
  select("Combined_ID", "Year", "Age", "Trick_or_Treat", "Candy_Type", "Rating", "Country", "State_or_Province", 
         "Gender")
```

These datasets were then combined together using the (rbind) function to make one dataset, and futher refinement and cleaning made to prepare it for analysis.

```{r eval=FALSE}

merged_candy_data_171819 <-rbind(candy_clean_2015, candy_clean_2016, candy_clean_2017) 

# Tidy the merged dataset

  #Country data - changing to title case
  tidied_candy_data <- merged_candy_data_171819  %>% 
  mutate(Country_clean = str_to_title(Country),
         .after = Country) %>%

### **3.2. General Assumptions**

**Age assumptions**
- Observations that did not contain an age value were removed
- Observations that contained valid ages with the age spelled in characters were converted to digits
- Observations where a definitive age could not be determined were removed, for example '24-50'/'50ish'
- Observations written in scientific notation were removed
- Observations with a decimal point were converted to whole numbers

**Country assumptions**
- Code was created to convert known variations of country names to the appropriate match, i.e. 'USA', 'United States', 'US', 'America' etc. to show as "US"
- Where no country was reported, but the respondent had reported a state or province, this was matched
to show the corresponding country using our best estimations.
- Unclear/ambiguous entries were converted to "Invalid Response", i.e. 'Somewhere'/ 'Not the USA or Canada'


# **4. Analysis and Observations**


**Q1.  What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years.**
**(Number of candy ratings, not the number of raters. Don’t count missing values)**

*OBSERVATION - A filter was applied to the 'Rating' column, to exclude responses with no ratings*

```{r eval=FALSE}
final_candy_data %>% 
  filter(Rating %in% c("DESPAIR","MEH","JOY")) %>% 
  nrow();
```


**Q2.  What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating?**

*OBSERVATION - For questions 2 and 3 a unique ID column 'Combined_id' was created at the initial cleaning stage of the individual raw datasets, in order to capture the number of unique respondents. Additionally, a filter was applied to the 'Age' column data to ensure only ages under 100 were used in the analysis.*

```{r eval=FALSE}
final_candy_data %>% 
  select(Age, Trick_or_Treat, Combined_ID) %>% 
  distinct(Age, Trick_or_Treat, Combined_ID) %>% 
  filter(Age <= 100) %>% 
  filter(Trick_or_Treat == "Yes") %>% 
  summarise(average_age_trick_or_treat = round(mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE))); 
```


**Q3. What was the average age of people who are not going trick or treating?** 


```{r eval=FALSE}
final_candy_data %>% 
  select(Age, Trick_or_Treat, Combined_ID) %>% 
  distinct(Age, Trick_or_Treat, Combined_ID) %>% 
  filter(Age <= 100) %>% 
  filter(Trick_or_Treat == "No") %>% 
  summarise(average_age_not_trick_or_treat = round(mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE))); 
```
         
         
**Q4.  For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar received the most of these ratings?**
        
*OBSERVATION - The response 'any full sized candy bar' received most of the 'JOY' ratings; however for the purposes of obtaining more accurate analysis the group decided to filter that response out.*
         
```{r eval=FALSE}
final_candy_data %>% 
  filter(Candy_Type != "invalid_response") %>% 
  filter(Rating %in% c("JOY", "DESPAIR", "MEH")) %>% 
  filter(Candy_Type != "any full sized candy bar") %>% 
  count(Rating, Candy_Type) %>% 
  group_by(Rating) %>% 
  slice(which.max(n));
```
         
         
**Q5.  How many people rated Starburst as despair?**
         
```{r eval=FALSE}
final_candy_data %>% 
  select(Candy_Type, Rating) %>% 
  filter(Rating == "DESPAIR") %>% 
  filter(Candy_Type == "starburst") %>% 
  count(Rating, Candy_Type);
```
         
  
**For the next three questions, count despair as -1, joy as +1, and meh as 0.** 

*OBSERVATION - A new dataframe was created to assign the numeric weightings to the ratings, for use in questions 7-9.*
         
```{r eval=FALSE}
candy_ratings_with_values <- final_candy_data %>% 
  mutate(numeric_rating = case_when(
    Rating == "DESPAIR" ~ "-1",
    Rating == "JOY" ~ "1",
    Rating == "MEH" ~ "0")) %>% 
      mutate(numeric_rating = as.numeric(numeric_rating));
```
         
         
**Q6.  What was the most popular candy bar by this rating system for each gender in the dataset?** 
         
*OBSERVATION - "any full sized candy bar" is the most popular for each gender therefore decided to filter this out to get more meaningful data*
        
```{r eval=FALSE} 
candy_ratings_with_values %>% 
  select(Candy_Type, numeric_rating, Gender) %>% 
  group_by(Gender, Candy_Type) %>% 
  summarise(rating_count = sum(numeric_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(Candy_Type != "any full sized candy bar") %>% 
  filter(rating_count == max(rating_count)) %>% 
  arrange(Gender, Candy_Type, rating_count);
```
         
         
**Q7.  What was the most popular candy bar in each year?** 

*OBSERVATION - "any full sized candy bar" is the most popular in each year therefore decided to filter this out to get more meaningful data*
         
```{r eval=FALSE}
         candy_ratings_with_values %>% 
           select(Candy_Type, numeric_rating, Year) %>% 
           group_by(Year, Candy_Type) %>% 
           summarise(rating_count = sum(numeric_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
           filter(Candy_Type != "any full sized candy bar") %>% 
           filter(rating_count == max(rating_count)) %>% 
           arrange(Year, Candy_Type, rating_count);
```


**Q8.  What was the most popular candy bar by this rating for people in US, Canada, UK, and all other countries?** 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Canada and UK
candy_ratings_with_values %>% 
  select(Candy_Type, numeric_rating, Country) %>% 
  filter(Country %in% c("US", "Canada", "UK")) %>%
  group_by(Country, Candy_Type) %>%
